# AirPure Innovations - AQI Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
AirPure Innovations is a startup focused on developing smart air purifiers and clean-air solutions in India.  
This project analyzes air quality data across various states to understand **pollution severity, health impact, and consumer demand triggers**.  
Insights from this analysis help shape product development, market strategy, and targeted awareness campaigns.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Map **AQI severity levels** across regions.
- Identify **key pollutants** and their trends.
- Correlate **air quality with health impacts** (outbreaks, mortality rates).
- Pinpoint **consumer behavior triggers** that increase demand for air purification.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for product deployment.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources
- **Primary Data**: Official AQI measurements from Dataful.
- **Secondary Data**: Public health statistics, vehicle registration data, and consumer behavior surveys.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **More diesel vehicles â†’ higher AQI â†’ more deaths/outbreaks** *(core finding)*.
- Seasonal variation significantly impacts pollution severity.
- Certain pollutants (PM10,PM2.5 andd NOâ‚‚) have direct links to respiratory illness outbreaks.
- Consumer purchase interest spikes after local AQI warnings.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Power BI** (Interactive Dashboard)
